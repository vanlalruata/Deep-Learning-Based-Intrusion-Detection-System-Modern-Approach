### Dataset used: KDDCup '99' and NSL-KDD

* KDDCup '99': http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html
* NSL-KDD: http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html

We went on to analyze the model's accuracy, recall, and f-measure to a greater extent. The DNN algorithm was tested using the given test data.

**Some improvement has been made in the code and you can use as it is, since the performance is better compare to the original coding.

Please cite the following papers, if you use the code as part of your research.
